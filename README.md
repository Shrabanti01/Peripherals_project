# Automatic Fire Extinguisher System

## Overview
A fire detection and suppression system that uses flame sensors and automated controls to detect and respond to fire hazards.

## Features
- Real-time fire detection  
- Automatic activation of buzzer, relay, and water pump  
- LED indication for system status  
- Reliable and efficient fire suppression  

## Components
- **Arduino Uno**  
- **Flame Sensor Module**  
- **LED (Light Emitting Diode)**  
- **Buzzer**  
- **12V & 7.4V Battery**  
- **5V Relay Module**  
- **Mini Water Pump & Pipe**  
- **Paperboard**  
- **Breadboard**  
- **Jumper Wires**  

## How It Works
1. The flame sensor detects fire.  
2. The system activates the buzzer and relay.  
3. The water pump is triggered for fire suppression.  
4. LED indicates system status.  
5. System resets after suppression.  

## Installation
- Assemble the hardware components.  
- Upload the firmware to Arduino.  
- Power the system.
